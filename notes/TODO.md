# TODO

- 3.1.12 Refresh route persistence: after browser refresh, restore the same
  authenticated product screen and, where applicable, the same nested tab.
  Apply one explicit navigation-state contract to Profile, File Review,
  Objects, Object Detail, Registration, Company Setup, Auth, and future screens.
  Preserve authorization checks and never restore a company-scoped resource
  without revalidating access. The current revision mirrors only safe route
  state into the outer Cloudflare URL, forwards it to each new Streamlit iframe,
  restores the selected Profile tab and persisted RFQ/estimate/object context,
  and reuses the existing Supabase ownership checks before rendering protected
  resources. Auth and invite-driven screens remain derived from their existing
  authorities. Active Processing intentionally fails safe to Upload because its
  file bytes and futures are not durable yet. The first production revision
  restored Profile after shared account controls had already rendered, causing
  duplicate `company_sign_out` keys. The corrected revision restores Profile
  and its tab before account controls render. The Cloudflare transition layer
  now covers both Profile to Upload and Upload to Profile while the restored
  screen is assembled. Status: accepted production checkpoint at `e48bb71`;
  the user confirmed refresh preserves Profile and its selected tab, no
  duplicate-key error remains, and both transition directions are clean.

- 3.1.11 Profile to Upload transition integrity: identify and remove the
  intermediate stale or partial screen visible after Continue to upload.
  Preserve the accepted Profile and Upload layouts, native button behavior,
  transition telemetry, and the v3.1.10 navigation callback. Production logs
  confirm a 0.712-second click-to-ready transition with only 0.291 seconds of
  server work and a 1.3ms Upload render; the visible defect is Streamlit's
  incremental client DOM patch while the old Profile marker is still present.
  The current revision reuses the Cloudflare startup mask only for this
  transition, reveals the iframe on the correlated Upload `app-ready`, and has
  a five-second fail-open timeout. Status: accepted production checkpoint at
  `4738cb3`; the user confirmed no intermediate screen in either direction
  between Profile and Upload.

- 3.1.10 Company Profile navigation and Overhead Expenses copy: restore the
  accepted v3.0.57 full-width tab rail on the current stateful, lazy-rendered
  tabs without reverting the v3.1.8 performance improvement. Use Overhead
  Expenses consistently in the table heading, save action, success message,
  and save errors. Remove the current React Aria selection underline, emphasize
  only the active tab, and remove the zero-height save bridge from document
  flow, including its outer Streamlit element wrapper, so Overhead Expenses
  starts at the same height as Contacts. Rename Price List to Price Lists.
  Preserve the working expense persistence path and defer Sign out sizing,
  Save Contacts, and Save Company Details. Status: production work-in-progress
  at `9ab5814`. The rail, active-tab bold treatment, plural `Price Lists`,
  Overhead Expenses copy, working Save, and removal of the red React Aria
  indicator are visually confirmed. A small residual vertical offset remains
  between the Overhead Expenses card and the other tab contents. Do not add a
  guessed negative margin. The accepted rollback boundary is `b58b1f5`, restored
  without history rewriting at `6a403b0`. Production telemetry then confirmed
  that the remaining whole-page jump is not scrolling or tab CSS: the transient
  zero-height `scroll_parent_to_top()` component occupies one 16px root layout
  gap on the first Profile render and disappears on the tab rerun. The current
  revision moves that utility component into the hidden Sidebar while preserving
  its scroll-reset behavior. The remaining Expenses-only offset was addressed by
  limiting `@st.fragment` to the save bridge instead of wrapping the complete
  tab. Profile to Upload navigation now changes screen state in a pre-render
  callback, preventing a partial Profile delta before the Upload rerun. Status:
  accepted production checkpoint at `3f8c80a`; the user confirmed the page no
  longer jumps, the Expenses alignment is correct, and Save remains functional.

- 3.1.9 Auth transition integrity: execute Sign in and every Sign out through
  native Streamlit callbacks before the next script render. Remove the
  intermediate Login/Profile render that can expose a broken screen or two
  logos. Preserve the current cookie, sessionStorage fallback, telemetry,
  native click behavior, and accepted layout. Status: functional production
  acceptance at `8182c51`. Clean Sign out measured 0.75-1.22 seconds and clean
  Sign in measured 1.29 seconds, with no broken screen observed. A telemetry
  follow-up closes failed Sign in transitions so later successful timings do
  not inherit stale correlation IDs.

- 3.1.8 Profile latency optimization: preserve the accepted six-tab geometry
  and working Save Expenses path, but render only the selected tab. Reuse the
  company access already verified in the current Python run and load the
  company profile row only for Contacts or Company Details. Status: accepted
  production checkpoint at `4c6d628`. Repeated Upload to Profile improved from
  3.36 seconds to 1.06-1.12 seconds, with server time reduced from 2.36 seconds
  to 0.29-0.30 seconds. The first cold transition improved from 4.23 seconds
  to 2.66 seconds.

- 3.1.7 Internal transition telemetry: measure Sign in, Upload to Profile,
  Profile to Upload, and Sign out from the browser click to the next rendered
  screen. Correlate each result with auth network time, company access lookup,
  Profile load, screen render, and Python reruns. The browser observer is
  passive and bubble-phase only. It must never cancel, delay, disable, or
  replace a native Streamlit click. Status: production measurements complete.

- 3.1.6 Streamlit runtime regression test: production was observed on unpinned
  Streamlit 1.64.0 while the verified local environment uses 1.58.0. Pin 1.58.0,
  rebuild production, and compare the same deep iframe startup boundaries. If
  startup does not improve or protected behavior regresses, revert the pin.
  Status: rejected. The first 1.58.0 Login took 7.06 seconds, followed by four
  iframe-only traces that never reached the auth component and timed out after
  8.26-8.39 seconds. Production is pinned back to 1.64.0 to prevent drift.

- 3.1.5 Deep iframe startup telemetry: split the embedded Streamlit startup
  gap into component script, component render, browser storage read, callback,
  and final app-ready boundaries. Record production Python, Streamlit, and
  Supabase versions before deciding whether to pin currently floating runtime
  dependencies. Status: implementation ready for production verification.

## Working rule
- A broken core layer must be repaired and validated at its actual integration point. Disabling or bypassing it is not an acceptable primary fix; fallback behavior is only an additional production safety mechanism.
- Every new two-file benchmark cycle starts two fresh instances on separate unused ports and opens both Chrome tabs automatically so `page-23.pdf` and `Металл (1).pdf` can run in parallel under the same code version. Keep older benchmark servers and result screens available for side-by-side comparison; stop them only on explicit request or when resource/port conflicts require cleanup.

## Active
- 3.1.2 Pilot Fast Resume: remove the initial browser-session rerun with a
  30-minute encrypted partitioned resume cookie, retain sessionStorage as the
  compatibility fallback, and keep Supabase as the authority for user and
  company access. Ship disabled first, then verify production enablement,
  fallback, expiry, tamper rejection, and two Sign out / Sign in cycles.
- 3.1.1 Production Observability Foundation: persist correlated browser and
  server timing boundaries without blocking render, changing UI geometry, or
  recording credentials, PII, file names, or RFQ content. Apply the Supabase
  migration and Cloudflare Function secrets before production verification.
- Company Profile follow-up after the v3.0.59 Save Expenses checkpoint:
  diagnose the duplicate heading observed after Sign out, then verify Contacts
  and Company Details remain on their selected tab after Save. Recheck the full
  sign-in, upload, profile, save, logout, sign-in, and reload cycle before
  declaring the checkpoint stable. The Other Spendings migration is applied.
  Do not change the accepted table geometry or the working Expenses save path.
- 3.2.1 Labor Costs: replace the placeholder with an owner-only employee cost
  register. The first production candidate uses one informal `Worker name`
  field, managed Department and Position lists, Monthly Salary or Hourly Rate,
  Average Hours per Month for hourly workers, and a derived Monthly Bruto total. The
  personnel records live in `company_employees`, separately from the Estimation
  `labor` catalog. Net salary, tax, pension, National Insurance, and total
  employer burden remain deliberately out of scope until their calculation
  contract is defined. The initial production version at `b6a3cd8` is an accepted
  rollback point. The current revision moves saved workers above the form, uses
  the Overhead Expenses typography, uses three-column role and hourly rows,
  removes numeric steppers, resets every field after Add, and opens owner-only
  editing from a small pencil beside the worker name. The rejected native-grid
  rewrite was reverted. The pencil is now before the name so edit controls form
  one vertical column. The selector fix targets Streamlit 1.64 React Aria groups,
  inputs, buttons, and option states while retaining the older BaseWeb rules.
  Status: accepted production checkpoint at `1df98c5`; the user confirmed the
  pencil alignment, vertically centered selector text, and purple focus states.
  The current minor candidate removes the extra Add Worker card top margin and
  limits bold disabled styling to calculated text inputs so the disabled
  `Select position` placeholder stays regular weight. Status: accepted
  production checkpoint at `dfcf5ef`; the user confirmed the final spacing and
  selector presentation.
- Auth UI follow-up: improve Sign out press/progress/completion feedback without changing the accepted Sidebar session component, adding JavaScript click interception, `pointer-events: none`, capture handlers, or focus-based infinite spinners. Preserve v3.0.51 refresh persistence and verify two consecutive Sign out / Sign in cycles.
- Unified Detection/OCR experiment sequence — quality first; every step must preserve the stable 3-object and 15-object boundaries before the next step begins:
  1. Make benchmark run IDs unique so repeated runs cannot overwrite prior object results. Direct PDF OCR remains the default one-PDF/one-request flow. Naming is text-only and receives locked Detection facts plus OCR snippets, never the PDF again.
  2. Validate the restored core Direct PDF OCR route on `mistral-ocr-4-0`. Structured vision annotation is excluded from the critical path because it changed a 2–3 second request into a 37–90+ second request. Record OCR completeness, p50/p95, dimensions, tokens, and total time.
  3. Continue the dimensions work already started. Bind every external dimension to the same object index, evidence page, and OCR region; never promote a component size to the whole-object envelope; when axes conflict, return unknown plus a concise clarification instead of guessing. Do not add another full-document pass.
  4. Make Naming text-only. Keep the separate Naming Agent and immutable object list, but stop sending it the PDF again. Pass indices, evidence pages, relevant OCR snippets, and locked Detection facts. Preserve current naming quality and target 2–3 seconds.
  5. Parallelize the first document stage. Start the single Direct PDF OCR request and visual-only commercial object locking at the same time. Join once both finish, then reconcile OCR evidence against the locked object IDs without a second full-document analysis.
  6. Parallelize the post-lock stage. After object IDs and order are immutable, start short Naming and technical OCR enrichment as parallel branches. Neither branch may add, remove, merge, split, or reorder objects.
  7. Completed in v3.0.35: File Review waits only for OCR, Detection, and the authoritative result save. Naming v4 now runs in the background, updates only unchanged provisional names, and no longer blocks the user; full OCR and runtime diagnostics also remain outside the critical path.
  8. Completed in v3.0.40: Processing uses measured Golden stage weights, an ease-in Detection curve, and OCR page-count pacing buckets; the early sprint and slow finish are removed without changing backend work.
  9. Run the acceptance benchmark. Use fresh files and at least three cold runs per file; compare object boundaries, names, dimensions, OCR completeness, p50/p95, tokens, cost, and total user-visible time.
  10. Prepare production concurrency later. Add organization-wide limits, backpressure queueing, 429 handling, and visual-only Detection fallback. Keep one PDF as one OCR request; do not restore per-page fan-out.
- Closed routing experiments:
  - Rendering pages while earlier pages entered OCR produced about 3.5 seconds of overlap on the 11-page file, but is superseded by Direct PDF because the main route no longer renders pages.
  - The 4-versus-6 page-worker experiment is retired. Future concurrency control applies across whole PDF requests from different users, not inside one document.
- Objects Estimation: manual sale price override should stay authoritative after self-cost changes, with manual label and SC-changed notice.
- Add overhead calculation layer after object material/labor pricing.
- Add deterministic delivery and installation pricing from project subtotal / overhead settings.
- Improve catalog matching: save matched material/labor rows and mark weak matches as `needs_review`.
- Run estimation for all detected objects, not only the first object.
- Design Objects Estimation status refresh without Streamlit stale-DOM fragments.
- UI copy: remove trailing periods from standalone UI text when no next sentence follows.
- Upload: continue first app/file-load optimization; warm refresh now uses the grey screen/app-ready path, but cold start after reboot can still show one Streamlit skeleton.
- Upload performance follow-up: lazy-load screens and cleanup are done; revisit `.streamlit/config.toml`, cold-start behavior, and optional post-deploy/reboot prewarm.
- Processing: review processing-screen text wording and keep its current position as the layout benchmark.
- Objects Estimation: reduce the large vertical gap between subtitle and pricing table column headers.
- Objects Estimation: add a small blue spinner next to the running Self Cost per Unit percent.
- Objects Estimation: format object quantities as whole units, not 1.0, after estimation completes.
- Objects Estimation: Delivery and Installation should not show Self Cost pending state or Pending review buttons; keep review/status area empty for project-level rows.
- Objects Estimation: keep Delivery and Installation as project-level percentage allocations and show their sale price inputs without fake object status.
- Object Detail: show AI Confidence when available.
- Object Detail: implement Object Preview image capture/display.
- Object Detail to Objects Estimation navigation: remove stale screen fragment flicker on return.
- Object Detail approve action: remove stale screen fragment flicker after clicking Approve.

## Later
- Large-PDF Detection routing: prevent Claude HTTP 413 before starting expensive work. Estimate the complete Messages payload size, including Base64 expansion, OCR context, prompt, and schema; never retry a non-retriable 413 through the fallback model. When the inline payload would approach the 32 MB Messages limit, upload the PDF once through the Anthropic Files API and pass its `file_id` instead of Base64. If the referenced document still exceeds the model context, split it into controlled page groups and reconcile one package-level object set. Persist OCR, upload, Detection, and failure timings for unsuccessful cycles.
- Audit and replace brittle layout code in Objects pricing rows and Upload dropzone when the current estimation/overhead flow is stable.
- Polish negative/error states with project button styles.
- Add XLS proposal export.
- Add missing-object second-pass detection flow.
