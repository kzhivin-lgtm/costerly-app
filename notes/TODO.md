# TODO

## Active
- Unified Detection/OCR experiment sequence — quality first; every step must preserve the stable 3-object and 15-object boundaries before the next step begins:
  1. Checkpoint the current candidate. Create a new experimental backup for Direct PDF OCR + Naming Split, and make benchmark run IDs unique so repeated runs cannot overwrite prior object results.
  2. Validate the new OCR route. Test one original PDF → one Mistral OCR request on cold, byte-unique or previously unseen documents. Record OCR completeness, p50/p95, dimensions, tokens, and total time; do not count possible provider deduplication as cold performance.
  3. Continue the dimensions work already started. Bind every external dimension to the same object index, evidence page, and OCR region; never promote a component size to the whole-object envelope; when axes conflict, return unknown plus a concise clarification instead of guessing. Do not add another full-document pass.
  4. Make Naming text-only. Keep the separate Naming Agent and immutable object list, but stop sending it the PDF again. Pass indices, evidence pages, relevant OCR snippets, and locked Detection facts. Preserve current naming quality and target 2–3 seconds.
  5. Parallelize the first document stage. Start the single Direct PDF OCR request and visual-only commercial object locking at the same time. Join once both finish, then reconcile OCR evidence against the locked object IDs without a second full-document analysis.
  6. Parallelize the post-lock stage. After object IDs and order are immutable, start short Naming and technical OCR enrichment as parallel branches. Neither branch may add, remove, merge, split, or reorder objects.
  7. Shorten the persistence path. Save the minimum authoritative result required for File Review, open File Review, and persist the full OCR JSON plus technical usage events concurrently or immediately afterward with reliable error reporting.
  8. Recalibrate the Processing UI only after the real route is stable. Drive progress from Direct OCR, visual locking, reconciliation, parallel post-lock work, minimum save, and completion; remove the current early sprint and slow finish.
  9. Run the acceptance benchmark. Use fresh files and at least three cold runs per file; compare object boundaries, names, dimensions, OCR completeness, p50/p95, tokens, cost, and total user-visible time. Promote the candidate only after quality and timing are both accepted.
  10. Prepare production concurrency later. Add organization-wide limits, backpressure queueing, 429 handling, and visual-only Detection fallback. Keep one PDF as one OCR request; do not restore per-page fan-out.
- Closed routing experiments:
  - Rendering pages while earlier pages entered OCR produced about 3.5 seconds of overlap on the 11-page file, but is superseded by Direct PDF because the main route no longer renders pages.
  - The 4-versus-6 page-worker experiment is retired. Future concurrency control applies across whole PDF requests from different users, not inside one document.
- Objects Estimation: manual sale price override should stay authoritative after self-cost changes, with manual label and SC-changed notice.
- Add overhead calculation layer after object material/labor pricing.
- Add deterministic delivery and installation pricing from project subtotal / overhead settings.
- Improve catalog matching: save matched material/labor rows and mark weak matches as `needs_review`.
- Run estimation for all detected objects, not only the first object.
- Design Objects Estimation status refresh without Streamlit stale-DOM fragments.
- UI copy: remove trailing periods from standalone UI text when no next sentence follows.
- Upload: continue first app/file-load optimization; warm refresh now uses the grey screen/app-ready path, but cold start after reboot can still show one Streamlit skeleton.
- Upload performance follow-up: lazy-load screens and cleanup are done; revisit `.streamlit/config.toml`, cold-start behavior, and optional post-deploy/reboot prewarm.
- Processing: review processing-screen text wording and keep its current position as the layout benchmark.
- Objects Estimation: reduce the large vertical gap between subtitle and pricing table column headers.
- Objects Estimation: add a small blue spinner next to the running Self Cost per Unit percent.
- Objects Estimation: format object quantities as whole units, not 1.0, after estimation completes.
- Objects Estimation: Delivery and Installation should not show Self Cost pending state or Pending review buttons; keep review/status area empty for project-level rows.
- Objects Estimation: keep Delivery and Installation as project-level percentage allocations and show their sale price inputs without fake object status.
- Object Detail: show AI Confidence when available.
- Object Detail: implement Object Preview image capture/display.
- Object Detail to Objects Estimation navigation: remove stale screen fragment flicker on return.
- Object Detail approve action: remove stale screen fragment flicker after clicking Approve.

## Later
- Detection quantity rules: complete units, sets, repeated views, linear meters, and component-versus-product counts.
- Detection Notes / missing information: keep only estimation-relevant uncertainty, assumptions, and specific questions; remove specification retelling and duplicated dimensions/materials.
- Audit and replace brittle layout code in Objects pricing rows and Upload dropzone when the current estimation/overhead flow is stable.
- Polish negative/error states with project button styles.
- Add XLS proposal export.
- Add missing-object second-pass detection flow.
