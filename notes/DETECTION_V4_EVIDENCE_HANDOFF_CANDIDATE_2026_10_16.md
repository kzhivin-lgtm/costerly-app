# Detection V4 evidence handoff candidate, 2026-10-16

Status: deployment candidate. It is not an owner-accepted production checkpoint until the production run and persisted input payload are reviewed.

## Decision

Detection V4's outcome is a correct, sufficient, auditable immutable `rfq_estimation_object_inputs.input_payload`, not an asserted external object envelope. Detection owns commercial object identity, source-label transport, physical quantity, full relevant physical pages and non-semantic visual regions.

Quantity is always present. It defaults to one unless source evidence proves another count. `review_required` records material count ambiguity.

Detection does not emit external dimensions, dimension candidates, nodes, detected materials, notes, missing information, or model confidence values.

## Evidence boundary

`presentation_preview_bbox` and its persisted crop are UI-only for File Review and Object Detail. Neither the crop nor its reference reaches Naming or Estimation.

The V4 input contains only object ID/name/quantity, cited physical pages, immutable full-page private artifacts and raw spatial OCR blocks from those pages. It carries no Detection roles, boundary claim, dimensions, materials, notes or preview ref.

Naming receives the locked object list, relevant full pages once per batch and object-specific OCR. It combines vision and OCR while preserving author code/label order. Estimation receives the same full pages and OCR after File Review, deduplicated by immutable storage reference in one batch.

## Metadata

`project_name`, `design_partner` and `client` remain separate. Design partner created the design or technical brief. Client is the end owner or operator. They may match only for source-supported self-designed direct commissioning. `author` remains hidden technical metadata.

## Protected behavior

The registry still locks commercial objects before Naming. Repeated views and kitchen/detail packages remain one commercial object. A shared physical page may belong to several object packages. Presentation Preview remains asynchronous and non-blocking for File Review.

## Migration and verification

`db/sql/2026_10_16_detection_v4_object_evidence.sql` adds `review_required` and permits `estimation_input_v4`. Focused V4 checks pass: 48 tests covering schema validation, handoff assembly, UI normalization, deferred Naming and timing paths. A direct live model smoke call did not return within its 30-second local observation window, so it is inconclusive, not acceptance.

Production acceptance requires one real upload with review of every object ID, quantity, pages, UI preview, OCR, naming result and persisted V4 input payload.
